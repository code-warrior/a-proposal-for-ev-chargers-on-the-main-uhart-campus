## Acronyms
* **DEEP**: Dept of Energy and Environmental Protection
* **NEMA**: National Electrical Manufacturers Association
* **EVSE**: Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (charging station and associated equipment)
* **ICE**: Internal Combustion Engine
* **RPH**: Range per Hour
* **HEV**: Hybrid Electric Vehicle (Prius)
* **PHEV**: Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (Prius Prime)
* **EV**: Electric Vehicle (Tesla)
* **BEV**: Battery Electric Vehicle, also known as an EV (Tesla)

## HEV Note
Any discussion about charging vehicles in this deck does not pertain to HEVs — or hybrids, as they’re more commonly known — as the electricity required to recharge these vechicle’s on-board battery isn’t supplied by EVSE.

---

# The Benefits of Adding EV Stations
* Gives the environmental program extra credibility.
* Makes the campus more desirable for prospective faculty, staff, and students.
* Keeps UHart contemporary with other local academic institutions.
* Gives the impression that UHart keeps abreast of upward trends in transportation.

## Who Has EV Chargers in the West Hartford Environs?
Perhaps the most interesting attitude towards EV chargers on campus comes from Wesleyan:

> “Add additional electric vehicle charging stations somewhere more central to campus, possibly by admissions. This would serve as a sign of Wesleyan's commitment to sustainability for visitors and potential students, and would encourage more faculty/staff to purchase hybrid and electric vehicles. The two chargers located by athletics are almost always in use, so clearly there is a demand for this on campus. I believe there is also still state money available to subsidize the project.”

## So, Why is Charging Free in Most Places?
* CT [provides incentives](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/11497)[^1] to offset the cost of EVSE installation.
* In exchange for the subsidy, the state requires that the site provides free EV charging to the public.
* Hence, free EV charging at places like The UConn Law School Library and Trinity College’s Crescent St parking lot, among other locations throughout Hartford.
* Paul Kritzler, Environmental Analyst at DEEP, said that CT is also receiving funds from Volkswagen.
* He’s likely referring to the [VW Settlement Information](https://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2684&q=587294&deepNav_GID=1619).
* Some VW funds are being awarded for EVSE installation. However, as of August 2019, there are no state incentives/subsidies.
* Kritzler said that subsidies may be reinstated in 2020, but was unsure as to a specific date.
* He advised me — and any interested parties — to [sign up](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=001YIysmm7Zby2v8N7gpaNE4FHXjSP7wJj58Iys44A5Z6Z5NY-S8IYebvy6RlHJWPdbEsNxUKhJutkdfCeGJKbxpQ1ZHc7VfHHvGyVbLgM73G4%3D)[^2] for notifications.

## Charging Levels
There are currently three levels of charging, and each varies wildly from the others.

* **Level 1**: Slowest, at about $$1.8kWh$$, providing about 5 RPH.
* **Level 2**: Most common, at about $$9kWh$$, providing about 25 RPH.
* **Level 3**: Fastest, at about $$50kWh$$, providing about 138 RPH.[^3]

[^3]: Tesla superchargers and other Level 3 chargers provide up to 120$$kWh$$ of charging, providing about 333 RPH.

**Note**: These numbers are typical, but your mileage may vary.

---

## Form Factors
The most common form factors for charging interfaces in the US:

* **J1772** (Level 1 and Level 2)
* **CCS 1** (Level 3)
* **CHAdeMO** (Level 3)[^4] [^5]

[^4]: “CHAdeMO” is a pun on “O cha demo ikaga desuka” in Japanese, meaning, “Let’s have a tea while charging” in English.

## Some Basic Electric Math
* $$amps \times volts = watts$$.
* A typical household outlet provides about $$15amps$$ at $$120volts$$.
* Thus, $$15amps \times 120volts = 1800watts$$ per hour, or $$1.8kWh$$.

---

## How Much Does the Consumer Pay for EV Charging at Home, Which is Level 1?
* Eversource charges me about $$\$0.19$$ per $$kWh$$, and all the outlets in my apartment [^6] supply about $$1800watts$$, or $$1.8kWh$$.
* Thus, $$1.8kWh \times \$0.19 = \$.34$$.

[^6]: A typical, Type B household plug, also known as a NEMA 5-15.

---

## How Much Electricity Does an EV Need to Travel One Mile?
* Charging my car for one hour ($$1800watts$$) from a standard plug provides me with $$5$$ miles of range.
* Therefore, 1 mile of range requires $$\frac{1800watts}{5miles} = 360watts$$.

---

## How Much Does the Consumer Pay for EV Charging on the Road, Which is Level 2?
* Every Level 1 or Level 2 charger I’ve visited in NY and CT, whether at a school or otherwise, has provided free charging.
* I have, however, paid for parking in lots that provide EV charging. For example:
   — *NY (Kew Gardens)*: $$\$3$$ for the first hour; $$\$2$$ each additional.
   — *CT (Blue Back Square)*: $$\$1.50$$ per hour.

## What Will the Least Expensive Level 2 Charger Cost UHart?
**Note**: The following excludes EVSE costs.

* Clipper Creek makes [the cheapest Level 1 charger]((https://store.clippercreek.com/all-products/level-1-16-amp-ev-charging-station-acs-120) I’ve found, at $$\$379$$.
* This charger comes with a [cheap lock](https://store.clippercreek.com/image/cache/catalog/New%20Free%20lock_gold%20on%20gen%202%20with%20type-800x800.jpg) to keep out unauthorized users.

## What Will the Most Expensive Level 2 Charger Cost UHart?
The following is a summary of an email from Joseph Inglisa, Director, Mid-Atlantic Business Development, SemaConnect, detailing the cost of SemaConnect charger installation. I imagine it’s similar for ChargePoint and others. **Note**: The following excludes EVSE costs.

1. The list price is $$\$3,590$$ per charging station, with volume pricing available.
2. Cable management devices cost $$\$600$$ for dual or single configurations.
3. The first year of network service is complimentary, after which the yearly cost is $$\$240$$.
4. There are no activation, turn on, or commissioning fees.
5. There are no taxes for shipping to CT; only UPS ground shipping is charged.
6. UHart chooses a kWh or hourly rate to cover or mark up electric costs.
7. UHart isn’t obligated to use SemaConnect, in the event that the University offers complimentary charging.
8. SemaConnect sends a quarterly payment based on the aforementioned user pricing.
9. SemaConnect nets out a 5% credit card transaction / management fee.
10. SemaConnect registers the customers’ credit card information and deals will all financial transactions.
