## HEV Note
Any discussion about charging vehicles in this deck does not pertain to HEVs — or hybrids, as they’re more commonly known — as the electricity required to recharge these vechicle’s on-board battery isn’t supplied by EVSE.

## Partial List of Local Colleges/Universities That Have EV Chargers?
| School | Amt of Chargers | Public or Private | Fee | Comment |
|--------|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:---:|:-------:|
| [Asnuntuck Community College](https://asnuntuck.edu/acc-has-free-electric-vehicle-charging-station/)   | 1       | Public | Free | None |
| [Trinity College](https://www.trincoll.edu/sustainability/climate-change/)                             | 4       | Public | Free | None |
| [Western Connecticut State University](https://www.wcsu.edu/news-archives/evchargingstations/)         | 4       | Public | Free | None |
| [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/sustainability/initiatives/transportation/options.html) | 10      | Mostly private; public discouraged | Free | Mainly for use by the Wesleyan community. Public users must obtain a parking permit or have their vehicle im-mobilized. |
| [UConn at Storrs and the School of Law](https://ecohusky.uconn.edu/electric-vehicles/)                 | Various | Public | Free | The UConn Law School has 2 chargers and the Storrs campus has 2 or more chargers.

## Who Has EV Chargers in the West Hartford Environs?
Perhaps the most interesting attitude towards EV chargers on campus comes from Wesleyan:

> “Add additional electric vehicle charging stations somewhere more central to campus, possibly by admissions. This would serve as a sign of Wesleyan's commitment to sustainability for visitors and potential students, and would encourage more faculty/staff to purchase hybrid and electric vehicles. The two chargers located by athletics are almost always in use, so clearly there is a demand for this on campus. I believe there is also still state money available to subsidize the project.”

## So, Why is Charging Free in Most Places?
* CT [provides incentives](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/11497)[^1] to offset the cost of EVSE installation.
* In exchange for the subsidy, the state requires that the site provide free EV charging to the public.
* Hence, free EV charging at places like The UConn Law School Library and Trinity College’s Crescent St parking lot, among other locations through the Hartford environs.
* As of August 2019, there are no state incentives/subsidies for EVSE installation.
* Paul Kritzler, Environmental Analyst at DEEP, said that subsidies may be reinstated in 2020, but he was unsure of to when exactly.
* He advised me, and any interested parties, to [sign up](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=001YIysmm7Zby2v8N7gpaNE4FHXjSP7wJj58Iys44A5Z6Z5NY-S8IYebvy6RlHJWPdbEsNxUKhJutkdfCeGJKbxpQ1ZHc7VfHHvGyVbLgM73G4%3D)[^2] for notifications.

## Some Basic Electric Math
* $$amps \times volts = watts$$.
* A typical household outlet provides about 15 $$amps$$ at 120 $$volts$$.
* Thus $$15 \times 120 = 1800watts$$ per hour, or $$1.8kWh$$.

---

## How Much Does the Consumer Pay for EV Charging at Home?
* Eversource charges me about $$\$0.19$$ per $$kWh$$, and the outlet at my home[^3] supplied about $$1800watts$$, or $$1.8kWh$$.
* Thus, $$1.8kWh \times \$0.19 = \$.34$$.

[^3]: A typical, Type B household plug, also known as a NEMA 5-15.

## How Much Electricity Does an EV Need to Travel One Mile?
* Charging my car for one hour ($$1800watts$$) from a standard plug provided me with $$5$$ miles of range.
* Therefore, 1 mile of range requires $$\frac{1800 (watts)}{5 (miles)} = 360watts$$.

---

## How Much Does the Consumer Pay for Level 2 EV Charging on the Road?
* Every Level 1 or Level 2 charger I’ve visited in NY and CT, whether at a school or otherwise, has provided free charging.
* I have, however, paid for parking. For example:
   — *NY (Kew Gardens)*: $3 for the first hour; $2 each additional.
   — *CT (Blue Back Square)*: $1.50 per hour.
