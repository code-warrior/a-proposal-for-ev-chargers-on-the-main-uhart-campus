## HEV Note

Any discussion about charging vehicles in this deck does not pertain to HEVs — or hybrids, as they’re more commonly known — as the electricity required to recharge these vechicle’s on-board battery isn’t supplied by EVSE.

## Who Has EV Chargers in the West Hartford Environs?
Perhaps the most interesting attitude towards EV chargers on campus comes from Wesleyan:

> “Add additional electric vehicle charging stations somewhere more central to campus, possibly by admissions. This would serve as a sign of Wesleyan's commitment to sustainability for visitors and potential students, and would encourage more faculty/staff to purchase hybrid and electric vehicles. The two chargers located by athletics are almost always in use, so clearly there is a demand for this on campus. I believe there is also still state money available to subsidize the project.”
